This is project 3 for CS 4760.

As I struggled with the previous project, I want to make sure that I approach this project with a thorough understanding of what it's asking and intending to accomplish. 

The brief synopsis of this project essentially is that there are 2 executables: oss which handles launching a certain number of worker processes and coordinating their execution utilizing the message queue. On the other hand, the worker processes creates child process that interact with the oss through message queue.
